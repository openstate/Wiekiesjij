----- Blockwrap ----

Wraps the content in a template.
Usage:
{% blockwrap %}
    Somecontent
{% endblockwrap %}

As default it will use the utils/blockwrap/_default.html template and just wrap it in a div with a class block:
<div class="block">
  Somecontent
</div>

Changing the template to use can be done by passing it a templatename:

{% blockwrap template='myown' %}
  Somecontent
{% endblockwrap %}

It will then use the utils/blockwrap/_myown.html template.
It will pass the content of the block as the context variable content

You can also pass it other variables if needed:

{% blockwrap title='MyTitle' %}
  Somecontent
{% endblockwrap %}

It will then also pass title to the context.
